Critical:
- homepage redirect to /login
- cant add Link path to the screens, think cuz it is not wrapped with browser router
-> bottom line: need to know how to build with react router

- may learn testing next time

Important features
- burger menu for mobile responsiveness
- custom scrollbar
- expanded accordion not overflowing in own column, spilling over the man container
